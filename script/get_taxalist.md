# Generate table of taxa information

We create a table with information about status, protection, etc by taxa. For this purpose: 

* First, we create a list with the taxa included in the database
* Then we fill out a table with information of the taxa from several sources 

### Get list of the taxa 
* SQL Query on the database 

```sql 

```

* Export the data and save as `./data/taxa_list.csv`
